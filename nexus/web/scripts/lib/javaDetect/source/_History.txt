Version History of getJavaInfo.jar
-----------------------------------



getJavaInfo.jar v5.2 (12/29/2014)
----------------------------------
- Is 1189 bytes.
- This jar applet now has a manifest. It specifies 'Permissions' header to be 'sandbox'.
Only the Permissions attribute is required in the customized manifest. We choose
sandbox because we want the applet to only run in the sandbox. The applet does not
need access to all the resources on your computer.
- The applet was compiled using JDK 1.7.0_67.
However, we used the rt.jar directly from JDK 1.2.2_017 for the compiled Java classes.
- The applet should work for JRE 1.1+. 


getJavaInfo.jar v5.1  (5/15/2013)
----------------------------------
- Is 858 bytes.
- Can be used with PluginDetect v0.8.2 or higher.
- The jarfile was NOT compressed by any 3rd party compression tools.
- The jarfile was compiled using jdk 1.6.0_35.
- The applet now has a red background, and will display the Java version
and the Java vendor. We did this to supply the user with a visual confirmation
that Java is indeed running in the browser. If the Java/Javascript bridge is not
working for some reason, then you will still be able to tell if Java is running or not.
- We removed the static isPlugin2() method. Its use depended on the Packages keyword,
but this keyword is no longer supported as of JRE 1,7,0_21+.


getJavaInfo.jar v5.0  (12/7/2012)
----------------------------------
- Is 624 bytes in size.
- Can be used with PluginDetect v0.8.0 or higher.
- The jarfile was NOT compressed by any 3rd party compression tools.
- The jarfile was compiled using jdk 1.6.0_35.
- We added a new method: isPlugin2()
 This method is only intended to be used with the per applet Packages keyword. From
 Javascript, we call the method like this:
     appletObject.Packages.A.isPlugin2()
 If this method runs and returns a result, then Java Plugin2 is installed and enabled.
 If the method does not run, then Java Plugin2 is not installed or not enabled.


getJavaInfo.jar v4  (11/22/2012)
---------------------------------
- Is 589 bytes in size.
- The jarfile was NOT compressed by any 3rd party compression tools.
- The jarfile was compiled using jdk 1.6.0_35.
- We only changed the getAppVersion() return result from "3" to "4" in order to change
 the binary signature of getJavaInfo.jar. This is because v3 of the applet was causing a
 false positive malware detection in Avira AntiVirus. Interestingly enough, the AntiVirus
 does not detect anything when the browser runs Java and loads the getJavaInfo.jar applet.
- From this point forward, I recommend that users customize the getJavaInfo.jar applet
for themselves to give it a unique binary signature (ie. unique md5 or SHA1 hash, or whatever). 
This should reduce the chances of a false positive detection in AntiVirus scanners.
Ways to customize are discussed in the "A.java" source code file.


getJavaInfo.jar v3  (8/12/2010)
--------------------------------
- Is 587 bytes in size.
- Does everything that previous versions do.
- getAppVersion() method has been added. Returns the version of the jarfile itself.
- The jarfile has NOT been compressed with any 3rd party compression tools.
We avoid any 3rd party tools to enhance reliability of the jarfile.
- The jarfile has been compiled using jdk 1.6.0_20.


getJavaInfo.jar v2  (1/13/2010)
--------------------------------
- Is 485 bytes in size.
- Does everything that version 1 does.
- Renamed getInfo() method to getProp()
- getProp(S) method where S is a string:
 allows PluginDetect to query the JRE for any additional Java properties that
 the JRE is willing to reveal. The query is in the format of System.getProperty(S) where S
 could be 'java.version', 'java.vendor', 'java.vm.name', 'java.vm.specification.name', etc...
- statusbar(S) method where S is a string:
 Will try to send the string S to the browser statusbar.
 We added this feature to allow PluginDetect to try to erase the "Applet A Started" message in the
 browser statusbar, which occurs in some browsers when the jarfile applet is running.
 The erase will only work if the browser allows this. The erase occurs from Java via the
 applet, not purely from Javascript.
- The jarfile has been compressed with the Java Archive Grinder (jarg.jar), which is a 3rd party
compression tool.


getJavaInfo.jar v2 beta1
-------------------------
- We added 2 more methods to the applet:
    getInfo(String S) - returns value of System.getProperty(S)
    statusbar() - sets the value of the browser status bar from Java.
       This only works sometimes depending on the browser, but it could allow you to
       overwrite the "Applet Started" message in the status bar when an applet starts up.
- This applet is backwards compatible with any Javascripts that use getJavaInfo.jar v1.


getJavaInfo.jar v1  (2/22/2007)
--------------------------------
- Is 359 bytes in size.
- Allows PluginDetect to query the JRE directly to determine the Java version and Java vendor.
- The jarfile has been compressed with the Java Archive Grinder (jarg.jar), which is a 3rd party
compression tool.
- There are 2 public methods:
  getVersion() method - returns Java version
  getVendor() method - returns Java vendor
