This page will test the getJavaInfo.jar applet in this folder to see if it works
and is compatible with the PluginDetect Library...<br/><br/>

In order for this test to work, you will need the following:<br/>

1) Make sure that Java is installed and enabled in your browser.<br/>
2) Your browser and your version of Java need to communicate via the Javascript/Java bridge.
Certain combinations of browsers and Java versions may not permit this communication.<br/>
3) Make sure that your getJavaInfo.jar applet is in this folder.<br/>
4) This test only needs to work on one browser and one version of Java in order for you to 
verify the getJavaInfo.jar applet.<br/>
5) If your browser has deactivated the Java plugin due to security reasons, then you will have
to activate it (ie. give security approval to run the plugin).<br/>
6) For Java 7 update 51 and higher, unsigned applets no longer run by default. If the applet you are using is unsigned, 
then you may have to go into your Java Control Panel and add this web page (or just the domain) 
to the Exception Site List. As an alternative, you could use a signed applet - but the cost 
for the certificate is high.<br>
7) This web page should probably be served by a WEB SERVER to your browser. The reason is that
some browsers/Java versions/Java security settings may require a WEB SERVER to be used in order for 
Java to run properly in a web page. (ie. your browser accesses the web page via a server, instead of
accessing the web page directly from your local disk drive)

<b>TESTING NOW BEGINS...</b><br/><br/>

<b>TEST # 1</b>: We attempt to display several instances of the Java applet in the boxes shown below.<br>
At least one (but not necessarily all) instance of the applet will appear as a <span style="color:#CC2222;font-weight:bold;">RED</span> rectangle, and will display the Java version and the Java vendor.
<br><br>

<div id="result1"></div><br/>

<b>TEST # 2</b>: We verify that the Java applet methods can be called from Javascript...<br>
<div id='result2'></div><br/>
<div id='result3'></div><br/>

<br/><b>TESTING IS DONE.</b><br/><br/>
