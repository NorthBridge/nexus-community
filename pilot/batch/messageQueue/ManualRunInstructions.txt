Reconstruct original message from pipe.log (Base64 decoder at https://www.base64decode.org)

Save as a recover file (i.e., recover1.txt)

Go to PROD script messageQueueProcessor.php

Save as messageQueueProcessorManual.php then swap line 8 for 9 (so you can read from recover from file instead of stdin)

Move recover file(s) to server

Run messageQueueProcessorManual.php against each recover file 
~/batch/apps/nexus/messageQueue php ./messageQueueProcessorManual.php

Takes 5-10 seconds. Expected output: Content-type: text/html

Delete messageQueueProcessorManual.php and recover file(s) from server
